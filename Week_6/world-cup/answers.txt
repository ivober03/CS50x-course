Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: In the first two simulations the predictions fluctuate a lot, in the first one the three teams that have a chance of winning later in the second simulation are displaced by three other teams that didn't even appear in the first one. Only after the third simulation do the probabilities begin to be consistent


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Id say that 10000 are enough simulations. After that, the predictions don't really change enough to justify further simulations.
